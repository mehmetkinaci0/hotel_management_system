This project is a desktop application developed for hotel management.  
It manages admin and customer operations using a MySQL database.

## Features

### Admin Operations
- **Check In**: Manage customer check-ins.  
- **Check Out**: Handle customer check-outs.  
- **Show Rooms**: List information about hotel rooms.  
- **Show Budget**: Display income and expense reports.

### Customer Operations

- **Call Housekeeper**: Allows customers to call the housekeeper.  
- **My Activity**: Show activities the customer has joined.  
- **Join Activity**: Allow customers to register for new activities.

## Database

- MySQL is used as the database system.  
- All customer, room, staff, and activity data are stored in the MySQL database.

## Installation

1. Visual Studio 2019 or later is required.  
2. MySQL Server must be installed and configured to connect with the project.  
3. Clone or download the project from GitHub.  
4. Open the `HotelManagementSystem.sln` file in Visual Studio.  
5. Build and run the project.

## Usage

- Admin users can perform hotel management tasks.  
- Customers can view their room and activity information and register for activities.  
- Customers can also call the housekeeper through the application.

## Notes

- The MySQL database is configured as **local** (on the same machine).  
- Therefore, the project will only work on a machine where the database is installed and set up.  
- To run the project on another computer, the database backup must be restored there.  
- Database connection settings can be easily updated in the project configuration or code.
